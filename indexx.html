                <p><b>Once upon a time,

                    there was a little boy of one-year-old named Khalid, the Grumpy Grandpa. He was born in Kabul in 1980, in the midst of the Russian invasion.
                    
                    Khalid’s young mother of 16 dreamed of raising her son in a beautiful and peaceful place called Canada. One quiet night, she made her bold move. Over the course of many weeks, the two travelled on donkeys over dangerous mountain terrains and by camel over desolate deserts, escaping their mother country.
                    As a third culture child, Khalid often pondered life, asking questions like, “Who am I? What is the purpose of life?

                    <p><b>Back in Canada, there was a young man – half gentleman, half hooligan – by the name of Trevor the Terrible! Actually, Trevor was an angel, but Terrible sounds cooler.

                        Trevor loved his parents, playing the guitar, and playing sports. His Scottish parents instilled a work hard play hard sensibility in young Trevor.
                        
                        As a young man, Trevor did well in Judo, as well as captained for Canada’s Junior Soccer team. He was a rising star, travelling around the world, experiencing different cultures while learning the lessons of hard work and sacrifice.
                        One day Trevor bumped his knee and no longer could play soccer.

                        <p><b>In his quest for home, Trevor discovers a wacky crazy boutique agency called Pixel Dreams. The work looks good, the culture seems cool, and the blog is filled with uncensored off-side raw content. Trevor is intrigued. He decides to take a pay cut from the big agency world and try his luck with the young start-up, Pixel Dreams.

                            Khalid and Lan hire Trevor.
                            Trevor quickly is promoted to Art Director, and then Partner.
